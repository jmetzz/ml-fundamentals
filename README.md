##Preamble
 
This repository contains the code used in *JArchitect's Tech Day* team event (April/2018).
Here you will find simple raw implementation of some well known **fundamental** machine learning algorithms,
which are useful for **educational purposes only**. Thus, please look around and take bits and snippets,
but by no means use them in production code. They are not designed/coded with performance and/or good practices in mind.

Moreover, at the moment it is *working in progress* project.

By the way, I'm using a bit of everything to show these 'fundamental algorithms'. You might find code written in python, R, java, kotlin or ... God only knows.
There is no guarantee that any code presented here works at all.

A brief description of the technical session:

**Title**: Diving in the fundamental machine learning algorithms: let's code them!

Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Evolutionary Algorithms, Deep Learning and so many others. Are these all buzzwords?
Nowadays everybody have heard (or read about) these terms, but seldom know how they really work. I mean it! The reason is quite simple: people don't know the basic concepts on which the most powerful algorithms are built upon. Therefore, let's shed some light upon the subject by implementing a few of the fundamental machine learning algorithms. Let's start with:

  - K-means and Hierarchical clustering;
  - CART with Gini index
  - Perceptron and Multi-layer Perceptron;
  - Back-propagation Multi-layer Perceptron; and
  - Genetic Algorithms

My intention is to add (no so near future) the following:
  - Improvements on Decision Trees;
  - Support Vector Machines; and
  - Deep Learning
